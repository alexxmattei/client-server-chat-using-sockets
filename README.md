# client-server-chat-using-sockets
Client Server Application for the purpose of learning how Socket communication between multi-client server applications works.

Server accepts multiple clients in the socket connection and exposes PORT 1234.
Client connects to PORT 1234 and once he specifies a username can send messages to the groupchat. 

Other clients can connect to the server group chat and can see the messeges sent from the moment they joined the chat.
